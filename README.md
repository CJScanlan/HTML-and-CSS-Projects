### One Page Website
This is a basic HTML webpage with CSS styling. The goal was to create a website for a gallery of images with simple navigation bars, a footer, a contact form, and a grid of photos. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate varying uses of CSS styling as well as building an HTML template for a single page site. 

### Academy Cinemas with Bootstrap
This is a basic one-page website for a pseudo movie theater. It utilizes Bootstrap framework and demonstrates its versatility. Bootstrap is utilized to create a navigation bar, a search box, a contact form, as well as cards for each movie and widgets for their showtimes. 

### Portfolio
HTML, CSS, and Javascript are utilized to construct a basic single page portfolio website. Javascript is used for a slideshow and pop-up contact form, and HTML builds the main functionality of the site. A fixed video background is included, as well as CSS animations upon loading.
